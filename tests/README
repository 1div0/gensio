This directory holds tests for gensio.  Note that there are also
extensive tests in ser2net.  These tests are more basic and
functional.

These tests require the linux serial simulation module in
linux-serialsim in this package.  You must load that module and the
user running the test must be able to access the serial ports
(generally you must be in the dialout group).
